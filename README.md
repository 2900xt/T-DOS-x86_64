# T-DOS

Operating system written in x86 assembly and cxx

# How to compile??

Relase: Prebuild.flp file is inside the releases directory!
Testing: Prebuilt.flp file can be found in the "build" folder.

Alternatively, build the testing version of OS by running "make test"
GCC-Directory in the makefile is :
/usr/local/x86_64elfgcc/bin/x86_64-elf-g++

# How do I run/try this?? 

Currently, the .flp precompiled image works with BOCHS and various other emulators like QEMU. (FDC doesn't work on QEMU).

Use the provided 'bochsrc.txt' to run T-DOS in bochs.
